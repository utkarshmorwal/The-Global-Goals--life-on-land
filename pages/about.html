                            <p class="card-text">Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests, usually as a result of human activities like agriculture, urbanization, logging, and infrastructure development.</p>

                            Global forest cover: Forests cover about 30% of the Earth's land area, but this number is decreasing rapidly.
                            
                            Causes:
                                - Agriculture (70-80%): clearing land for crops, livestock, and other agricultural purposes
                                - Urbanization (10-20%): expanding cities and infrastructure
                                - Logging (5-10%): harvesting timber and wood products
                                - Infrastructure development (5%): building roads, dams, and other projects
                            
                            Effects:
                                - Loss of biodiversity: forests are home to 80% of the world's terrestrial species
                                - Climate change: forests absorb carbon dioxide, and deforestation contributes to greenhouse gas emissions
                                - Soil erosion: trees hold soil in place, and without them, soil can be washed or blown away
                                - Water cycle disruption: forests play a crucial role in regulating water cycles and river flow
                            
                            Solutions:
                                - Sustainable forest management
                                - Reforestation and afforestation efforts

                    - 75% of insect species have declined in population
                
                - Causes:
                
                    - Habitat destruction and fragmentation
                    - Overexploitation (overfishing, overhunting)
                    - Climate change
                    - Pollution
                    - Invasive species
                
                - Consequences:
                
                    - Ecosystem disruption and collapse
                    - Loss of ecosystem services (pollination, pest control)
                    - Decreased food security
                    - Negative impacts on human health
                    - Economic losses (tourism, fisheries, forestry)
                
                - Solutions:
                
                    - Conservation and restoration of habitats
                    - Sustainable use of resources
                    - Climate action
                    - Pollution reduction
                    - Invasive species management
