                        <p class="card-text">Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests, usually as a result of human activities like agriculture, urbanization, logging, and infrastructure development.</p>
                        <button type="button" class=" btn btn-md btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-title="About deforestation" data-bs-content="Rate of deforestation: According to the United Nations, around 13 million hectares of forest are lost each year, equivalent to the size of Panama.

                        Global forest cover: Forests cover about 30% of the Earth's land area, but this number is decreasing rapidly.
                        
                         Causes:
                            - Agriculture (70-80%): clearing land for crops, livestock, and other agricultural purposes
                            - Urbanization (10-20%): expanding cities and infrastructure
                            - Logging (5-10%): harvesting timber and wood products
                            - Infrastructure development (5%): building roads, dams, and other projects
                        
                         Effects:
                            - Loss of biodiversity: forests are home to 80% of the world's terrestrial species
                            - Climate change: forests absorb carbon dioxide, and deforestation contributes to greenhouse gas emissions
                            - Soil erosion: trees hold soil in place, and without them, soil can be washed or blown away
                            - Water cycle disruption: forests play a crucial role in regulating water cycles and river flow
                        
                         Solutions:
                            - Sustainable forest management
                            - Reforestation and afforestation efforts
                            - Conservation and protected areas
                            - Certification and labelling of sustainable products (e.g., FSC certification)
